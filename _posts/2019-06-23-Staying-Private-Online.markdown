## Why we need Privacy

Data leak, big-tech scandals, hacking and online surveillance are hot topics in our day to day news. We show varied reactions to this news. Some of us get scared, some get confused, some complaints but no one seems to care. Most of us assume these atrocities affect some unknown third person. But fail to acknowledge the fact that we are the real victims.

During our discussions on privacy, we often repeat the argument “I don’t have anything to hide”. This argument is misleading. We need privacy in our online transactions for the same reason “Bathroom needs a door”. Bathing is normal, legal and acceptable. But why we prefer doing it in closed personal space instead of a street corner?. The answer is we need our privacy. In the same way, we need to hide certain aspects of our online life from other's prying eyes.

Hereafter, If someone claims they have nothing to hide, ask their google login id and password.  We can have loads of fun by touring their online activity history.

## Whom to trust

I am not saying, every online services surveillance us or steal our data. There are lots of open source and privacy-respecting services available online. But, the real issue lies in figuring out whom to trust. Every week on average we use hundreds of online services, and in a year it scales to several thousand. It is overwhelming for us to read through the privacy policies of all the services we use. Often privacy policy documents are confusing and misleading.

We also overlook the third party trackers and cookies used by online services. Tracing their origin and intentions are not that straightforward for normal users. Naturally, it is safe to stay private as much as possible.

## Common Vulnerablities

Following are some common vulnerablities we face online.

* Other users in your WIFI network can easily hack the network and access your private data.  So, it is dangerous to do any bank transactions in public WiFi without a VPN.
* Most of the websites we visit allow third-party cookies and scripts. They track activity and usage patterns and sell the data for targeted ad campaigns. 
* Hackers use the usernames and passwords leaked by data breach for login to our services. This is a very big vulnerability if we are reusing passwords.
* Some websites may install malware or use our system's to mine cryptocurrencies.
* Browser extensions we use can read and track every activity we do online. It is dangerous to use unverified closed source extensions.
* Internet service providers track our online activities. They might sell our data to shady marketers and corporations to use against us.
* Closed source browser like chrome may track all our activities and report to google.
* Governments may put you under large scale surveillance programs.  These programs can disproportionally affect certain social groups based on ethnicity and religion.
* Unethical activities like targeted election campaigns can use our leaked online personal data. 
* People get harassed when their leaked data contains opinions different from larger society.

## How to stay private

Staying 100% private online is not that easy. Even using services like tor won’t ensure full privacy and anonymity. Protecting our privacy involves following some best practices and using open source tools.

### *Best Practices*

* Ditch chrome, switch to Firefox or Brave browser. If your work needs chrome, use it only for work.
* Never reuse your passwords.
* Create long complicated passwords comprising numbers and special characters. If you find difficulties in remembering passwords use open source password managers like Bitwarden.
* Be extra cautious when visiting sites that claim to provide paid content for free.
* setup multi factor authentication for all the banking and social media acconts.
* Always prefer open source, as the code is always available for audit.
* Avoid google, instead, use search engines like Duckduckgo. 

### *Privacy Tools*

Following are some of the tools I recommend to start with. Do enough research before using them.

* Use a VPN, avoid free ones. Do thorough research before buying one.
* Use Bitwarden to generate and store all your complex passwords. `(Free and open source)`
